# SolarSage - Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Purpose

SolarSage is an AI-powered web application designed to help homeowners and solar panel owners understand their solar energy performance, optimize costs, and compare their systems with neighbors. The platform bridges the gap between complex electricity bills and actionable insights.

## 🌍 Motivation

### Problem Statement
- Electricity bills are complex and difficult to understand
- Solar panel owners lack visibility into their system's true performance
- No easy way to compare solar efficiency with similar systems nearby
- Missing potential savings opportunities go unnoticed

### Solution
SolarSage automates bill analysis using AI, providing clear insights into:
- How much solar energy you're generating
- Whether your system is performing optimally
- How you compare to neighbors
- Opportunities to save money

## 💡 Core Objectives

1. **Simplify Bill Analysis**: Transform complex PDF bills into clear, actionable data
2. **Performance Insights**: Show if solar systems are underperforming
3. **Cost Optimization**: Identify savings opportunities
4. **Community Benchmarking**: Enable peer comparison for motivation
5. **Accessibility**: Make solar analytics available to non-technical users

## 🎨 Target Audience

- **Primary**: Homeowners with solar panel installations
- **Secondary**: Property managers, solar installers, energy consultants
- **Guest Users**: Anyone curious about solar performance analysis

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes
